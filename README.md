# Obsidian Markdown Cheatsheet
[![ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/img/githubbutton_sm.svg)](https://ko-fi.com/Z8Z71B3VAA)

A simple Markdown Cheatsheet I created to help me learn obsidian. It's not intended to cover 100% of what you can do, but just provide syntaxes to jog your memory and get you started.

Feel free to download and use, share, etc.

Hope it helps! If it does, consider buying me--a poor coder (steady there, Sparkplug!)--a cup of [Ko-fi!](https://ko-fi.com/swenlarsen). It would be greatly appreciated! 

Also, you may wish to check out my other project, [Obsidian Vault Health Check](https://github.com/slappycat2/obsidian-vault-health-check). Again, it's free, open-source, and I hope it helps!
